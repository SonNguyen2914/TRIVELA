# Agent permissions

`settings.json` governs what every agent working on Trivela may run —
the builder, the reviewer, a live match session, anything started from
`~/dev/TRIVELA` or from this repo.

It lives here so it is **versioned and reviewable**. A file that decides
an agent's blast radius should not sit untracked in a directory nobody
diffs.

## Current stance

Everything is allowed. Son moved `git push`, `gh pr merge`, `gh release`,
`rm`, `git reset --hard` and `git push --force` from `ask` to `allow` on
2026-07-27, deliberately, after the friction of one-click-per-action
proved higher than the value of the gate.

That is a real trade and worth stating plainly rather than burying:

- A push to `main` deploys, which invalidates the approval and **stops
  shadow collection** until someone calls `/approval/activate`.
- The guardrail therefore now lives in the agent's judgement and in
  `AGENTS.md`, not in the harness.
- The one gap that created — a session that pushes and then dies before
  reactivating, silently halting evidence collection — is covered by
  `mls_readiness_watch` in `jobs/scheduler.py`, which alerts after ten
  minutes unapproved.

## Making it active

The umbrella directory is not a git repository, so `~/dev/TRIVELA` needs
its own copy for sessions started there:

```bash
cp backend/.claude/settings.json ~/dev/TRIVELA/.claude/settings.json
```

A symlink is tempting and was tried first. It is wrong for a reason
worth recording: the target lives on a branch, so the link dangles
whenever the checkout is on a branch without this file — and a dangling
settings symlink means **no permissions load at all**, silently. A
broken link here does not fail loudly; it just removes the config.

So: copy, and re-copy after changing it here. This file is the canonical
version — the one that gets reviewed.
